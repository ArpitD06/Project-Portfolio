# PROJECT 7: k-MEANS CLUSTERING USING SCIKIT-LEARN IN PYTHON

#Dataset : Minute Weather---
'''
The minute weather dataset contains raw sensor measurements captured at one-minute
intervals.The data is in the file minute_weather.csv, which is a comma-separated file.
Each row in minute_weather.csv contains weather data captured for a one-minute interval. Each
row, or sample, consists of the following variables:
o rowID: unique number for each row (Unit: NA)
o hpwren_timestamp: timestamp of measure (Unit: year-month-day hour:minute:second)
o air_pressure: air pressure measured at the timestamp (Unit: hectopascals)
o air_temp: air temperature measure at the timestamp (Unit: degrees Fahrenheit)
o avg_wind_direction: wind direction averaged over the minute before the timestamp (Unit:
degrees, with 0 means coming from the North, and increasing clockwise)
o avg_wind_speed: wind speed averaged over the minute before the timestamp (Unit: meters
per second)
o max_wind_direction: highest wind direction in the minute before the timestamp (Unit:
degrees, with 0 being North and increasing clockwise)
o max_wind_speed: highest wind speed in the minute before the timestamp (Unit: meters per
second)
o min_wind_direction: smallest wind direction in the minute before the timestamp (Unit:
degrees, with 0 being North and inceasing clockwise)
o min_wind_speed: smallest wind speed in the minute before the timestamp (Unit: meters
per second)
o rain_accumulation: amount of accumulated rain measured at the timestamp (Unit:
millimeters)
o rain_duration: length of time rain has fallen as measured at the timestamp (Unit: seconds)
o relative_humidity: relative humidity measured at the timestamp (Unit: percent)

1. Inertia: Lower inertia indicates that points are closer to the centroids.
2. Silhouette Score: A score closer to 1 to -1 (closer to 1 is good cluster and closer to -1 is wrong cluster indicates) 
3. Davies-Bouldin Index: Lower values indicate better clustering with less overlap between clusters
