 [Analysis of TED_TALKS Project](https://github.com/ArpitD06/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20TED_TALKS.py) |Description :This project provides an in-depth analysis of TED Talks using Python to extract insights into what drives the popularity, engagement, and reach of various TED Talks. By exploring view counts, comments, themes, speakers, and other factors, this project identifies trends and patterns in TED Talks from multiple perspectives. Key analyses include: 1.Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data by converting timestamps to readable dates and reordering features for better usability.  2.Top TED Talks: Identified the 15 most-viewed TED Talks and visualized their popularity through a bar chart.  3.Views and Comments Analysis: Examined the distribution of views and comments, calculated summary statistics, and investigated the correlation between views and comments. A joint plot and correlation matrix were created to visualize this relationship.  4.Temporal Analysis: Analyzed TED Talk activity by month, day, and year to discover popular times for TED events, including TEDx, and created heat maps to visualize trends over time.  5.Speaker and Occupation Analysis: Examined speaker frequency and occupation to identify which professions draw the most views, using box plots to compare views across different speaker occupations.  6.Thematic Analysis: Explored talk themes using tags and identified the most popular themes, presenting the distribution through bar charts and cross-tabulations. 7.Language and Duration: Assessed the reach of TED Talks in different languages and analyzed talk duration to see how it impacts views | 
 [Analysis of eCommerce Data](https://github.com/ArpitD06/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20eCommerce%20Data.py) |Description : This project aimed to tackle several key issues faced by eCommerce businesses. The primary challenges included understanding customer satisfaction, accurately predicting sales, optimizing delivery performance, and analyzing product categories for dissatisfaction. The project involved handling incomplete data and developing strategies to improve delivery times.     ##Tools and Technologies:  1.Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy   2.Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  3.Machine Learning: Scikit-learn  4.Statistical Analysis: Statsmodels  5.Natural Language Processing: NLTK, TextBlob     ##Key Steps: 1.Data Collection and Cleaning: Gathered data from various sources and cleaned it using Pandas to ensure accuracy and consistency.  2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends and patterns in the data.  3.Machine Learning Modeling: Built predictive models using Scikit-learn to forecast sales and identify key factors affecting customer satisfaction.  4.Statistical Analysis: Employed Statsmodels for in-depth statistical analysis to validate the findings.  5.Natural Language Processing: Utilized NLTK and TextBlob to analyze customer reviews and extract insights on satisfaction factors.  ##Outcomes:  Achieved 75% of customer reviews highlighting satisfaction factors such as fast delivery and product quality. Forecasting predicted a 30% revenue increase for the upcoming year. Delivery time analysis indicated a 20% opportunity for improvement. Identified 25% of product categories as key focus areas for enhanced performance| 
  [HOTEL_BOOKING_Visualization ](https://github.com/ArpitD06/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/HOTEL_BOOKING_visualization.py) |This project focuses on analyzing and cleaning a hotel bookings dataset using Python and key data visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. The dataset is initially explored for its structure, missing values, and data types. A heatmap is used to visualize missing data patterns, followed by filling in missing numeric and categorical values through mean and mode imputation. The project also detects outliers using histograms and boxplots, providing insights into key variables like children and total_of_special_requests. The goal of the project is to prepare the dataset for further analysis by handling missing data, outliers, and duplicates, while ensuring data integrity. .| 
  [IRIS_data_Visualization ](https://github.com/ArpitD06/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/IRIS_data_Visualization.py) | This project focuses on the visual exploration of the famous Iris dataset, which is widely used in pattern recognition and classification tasks in machine learning. The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each characterized by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset is divided into three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica.  ##Key Features: 1.Data Loading and Preprocessing: The project begins by importing the necessary libraries and loading the Iris dataset. Basic preprocessing is performed to ensure the data is clean and ready for analysis. 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project employs various visualizations to understand the relationships between different features and how they vary across species. Key visualizations include: Pair Plots: These plots display the pairwise relationships between features, allowing for a quick visual assessment of the dataset's structure. Histograms: Histograms are used to show the distribution of each feature, highlighting the differences between species. 3.Box Plots: Box plots provide insights into the spread and outliers of the feature values for each species.  4.Visualization Customization: The project demonstrates how to customize plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn, enhancing the clarity and aesthetics of the visualizations.  5.Insights and Conclusion: The analysis reveals distinct patterns in the features across the three species, contributing to a better understanding of the dataset. This exploration serves as a foundation for further analysis and model building. ##Conclusion : This Iris data visualization project showcases the power of visual data exploration in uncovering patterns and insights within a well-known dataset, providing valuable experience in using Python for data analysis and visualization techniques  |
