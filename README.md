 [Analysis of TED_TALKS Project](https://github.com/ArpitD06/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20TED_TALKS.py) |OBJECTIVE :This project involves a comprehensive analysis of TED Talks data to uncover insights into the popularity, engagement, and thematic trends of the talks. The dataset includes information on talks, speakers, events, and viewer interactions.            ## Tools and Technologies: Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy    Statistical Analysis: Scipy, Statsmodels        Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn                   Text Analysis: WordCloud, NLTK, TextBlob       ## KEYSTEPS :    1. Data Preparation and Column Reordering:  Reorders columns for easier access and converts UNIX timestamps (in film_date and published_date) into a human-readable date format.          2. Most Viewed Talks: Identifies the 15 most-viewed TED Talks of all time.    3. View Count Distribution:  Analyzes the distribution of view counts across talks to understand general popularity.   4. Comment Distribution: Explores the number of comments per talk, with histograms showing the full range and comments under 5000 for a refined view.    5.Most Commented Talks: Lists the top 10 most-commented talks along with their views .  6. Seasonal Trends: Examines monthly and daily trends to find popular times for TED events..7. TED Talks over the Years: Tracks TED Talk frequency by year with a line plot and creates a heatmap to visualize the count by month and year. 8. Speaker and Occupation Analysis: Identifies the most frequent speakers and examines if specific occupations attract more views using box plots for popular professions. 9. Multiple Speakers: Counts talks with multiple speakers. 10. TED Events: Ranks events by the number of uploaded talks to determine the most significant TED events. 11.Language Distribution:  Displays the distribution of languages across talks and investigates if certain languages correlate with higher viewership. | 
 [Analysis of eCommerce Data](https://github.com/ArpitD06/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20eCommerce%20Data.py) |Description : This project aimed to tackle several key issues faced by eCommerce businesses. The primary challenges included understanding customer satisfaction, accurately predicting sales, optimizing delivery performance, and analyzing product categories for dissatisfaction. The project involved handling incomplete data and developing strategies to improve delivery times.     ##Tools and Technologies:  1.Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy   2.Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  3.Machine Learning: Scikit-learn  4.Statistical Analysis: Statsmodels  5.Natural Language Processing: NLTK, TextBlob     ##Key Steps: 1.Data Collection and Cleaning: Gathered data from various sources and cleaned it using Pandas to ensure accuracy and consistency.  2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize trends and patterns in the data.  3.Machine Learning Modeling: Built predictive models using Scikit-learn to forecast sales and identify key factors affecting customer satisfaction.  4.Statistical Analysis: Employed Statsmodels for in-depth statistical analysis to validate the findings.  5.Natural Language Processing: Utilized NLTK and TextBlob to analyze customer reviews and extract insights on satisfaction factors.  ##Outcomes:  Achieved 75% of customer reviews highlighting satisfaction factors such as fast delivery and product quality. Forecasting predicted a 30% revenue increase for the upcoming year. Delivery time analysis indicated a 20% opportunity for improvement. Identified 25% of product categories as key focus areas for enhanced performance|
