 [Analysis of TED_TALKS Project](https://github.com/ArpitD06/Project-Portfolio/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20TED_TALKS.py) |OBJECTIVE :This project involves a comprehensive analysis of TED Talks data to uncover insights into the popularity, engagement, and thematic trends of the talks. The dataset includes information on talks, speakers, events, and viewer interactions.            ## Tools and Technologies: Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy    Statistical Analysis: Scipy, Statsmodels        Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn                   Text Analysis: WordCloud, NLTK, TextBlob       ## KEYSTEPS :    1. Data Preparation and Column Reordering:  Reorders columns for easier access and converts UNIX timestamps (in film_date and published_date) into a human-readable date format.          2. Most Viewed Talks: Identifies the 15 most-viewed TED Talks of all time.    3. View Count Distribution:  Analyzes the distribution of view counts across talks to understand general popularity.   4. Comment Distribution: Explores the number of comments per talk, with histograms showing the full range and comments under 5000 for a refined view.    5.Most Commented Talks: Lists the top 10 most-commented talks along with their views .  6. Seasonal Trends: Examines monthly and daily trends to find popular times for TED events..7. TED Talks over the Years: Tracks TED Talk frequency by year with a line plot and creates a heatmap to visualize the count by month and year. 8. Speaker and Occupation Analysis: Identifies the most frequent speakers and examines if specific occupations attract more views using box plots for popular professions. 9. Multiple Speakers: Counts talks with multiple speakers. 10. TED Events: Ranks events by the number of uploaded talks to determine the most significant TED events. 11.Language Distribution:  Displays the distribution of languages across talks and investigates if certain languages correlate with higher viewership. |
